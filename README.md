# Customer-retention-model-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
 - I used ANN techniques to create a model that could classify/predict whether an customer in bank will stay with the bank or not.
 - Created a model with accuracy of 84.35% on the test set with the hyper parameters optimized by running a grid search.
 - Analyzed the feature to see the distribution of customer age, bank balance, credit score etc using visualization techniques.
